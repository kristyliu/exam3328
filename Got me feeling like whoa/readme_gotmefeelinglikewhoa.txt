The challenge:
- Do something interesting.

Write a sketch that shows off your skills. Don't forget to add comments. 

When the sketch is complete, test it. If you are happy with the results, save the sketch. Use a file name that includes your first or last name. Let Kim know that you are done. 

You will be scored on functionality, creativity, and how much you challenge yourself in your choice of task and how you execute it.
