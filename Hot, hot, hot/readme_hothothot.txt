The challenge:
- Your sketch must include functions that read the analog input of the temperature sensor.
- Your sketch much control at least two actuators based on different states of input from the temperature sensor.  

Write a sketch that operates two or more actuators based on the input from reading the temperature sensor. Don't forget to add comments. 

When the sketch is complete, test it. If you are happy with the results, save the sketch. Use a file name that includes your first or last name. Let Kim know that you are done.
