The challenge:
- You must fill in the correct declarations and setup for each LED.
- You must use a declaration to set the delay between individual LEDs.
- You must reverse the order in which the lights turn off.  

Your task is to change the sketch so that it contains all of the necessary declarations and setup. In addition, add a declaration as a placeholder for the delay between individual LEDs. Finally, reverse the order in which the lights turn off. 

When the sketch is complete, test it. If you are happy with the results, save the sketch. Use a file name that includes your first or last name. Let Kim know that you are done. 

You will be scored on functionality, creativity, and how much you challenge yourself in your choice of task and how you execute it.
