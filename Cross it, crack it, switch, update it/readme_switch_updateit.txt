The challenge:
- You must use at least two separate actuators (each LED or color on the RGB LED counts as one)
- Your finished sketch must have at least two possibles states of operation based on the input from a button or switch.

Write a sketch that operates two or more actuators based on the input from a switch or button. Don't forget to add comments. 

When the sketch is complete, test it. If you are happy with the results, save the sketch. Use a file name that includes your first or last name. Let Kim know that you are done. 

You will be scored on functionality, creativity, and how much you challenge yourself in your choice of task and how you execute it.
